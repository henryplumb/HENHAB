Code for a High Altitude Balloon using the Raspberry Pi as a flight computer.

Many thanks to ibanezmatt13 for his original 'NORB' code which this is based on.

This code interfaces a Ublox Max 6 GPS, NTX2B Radio Module, Raspberry Pi Camera Module, DS18B20 temperature sensor and a BMP085 pressure sensor with a Raspberry Pi, sending the data back as a telemtry string via the NTX2B Radio Module as per the UKHAS communication format.
