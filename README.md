HENHAB
======

Flight code for the HENHAB High Altitude Balloon. This code integrates a Ublox GPS module, NTX2B radio module, DS18B20 temperature sensor and BMP095 pressure sensor with the Raspberry Pi as a flight computer.

Many thanks to ibanezmatt13 and chrisstubbs93 for their HAB code which has helped me greatly with this.

SSDV requires you have the 'ssdv' program by fsphil installed.
